            <h3>Introduction to Shadows</h3>
            <p>Shadows are a natural part of our world and help us perceive distance, position, and other information about the objects around us.
            </p>
            <p>A great example on how shadows help us perceive our world is this video to the right. The basketball does not change its path or movement all that changes is the shadow. 
                By changing the shadow our brain interprets the path of the ball differently. 
                <p>Just like in the physical world we use shadows to help people interpret UI. Shadows in UI help us interpret elevation, hierarchy, and emphasize elements. 
                    I hope this site will help provide some guidance on how to use shadows on any user interface.

            <h3>Drop Shadow for text</h3>
            <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) specify a minimal contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against adjacent colour(s) Drop shadows can 
                help maintain this ratio epically when the background is not a consistent color like a gradient, pattern, or image.</p>

            <p>An example is boxes and text to the right. Both boxes are the same color and have the same color text. 
                You will notice how with just a very basic drop shadow the text becomes a lot more visible.  </p>

            <h3>Drop shadow for images</h3>
            <p>Drop Shadow can be used to help draw attention and separate an image from a background. The example to the right uses a shadow to distinguish the yellow drill 
                and the yellow background. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Shadows elevate a design but can distract if they are too strong or large. Most of the time a drop shadow should only be used 
                for showing elevation like for example when a navbar is over other content it should have a shadow showing that it is above other content.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Drop Shadows used in UI are an important part of making sure users 
                can perceive the content and can understand how an application functions. </p>
                <p>
                    Shadows can help improve readability for those who are vision impaired. Overuse of shadows can be more distracting than helpful if overused. 
                    Remember the purpose of shadows is to help improve text readability especially for large headings. Improved contrast on images can help users use an your application 
                    easily. When designing an UI and shadows are being considered, add them sparingly. Save shadows for elevated UI elements of media that needs to be emphasized.
